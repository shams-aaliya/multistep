In this repository I am trying to create a multistep form using 3 different ways:
#1 being the easiest and widely used method i.e. Using HTML, CSS and JS
#2 being one of the most popular frontEND library i.e ReactJS
#3 being one of the most popular frontEND framework i.e VueJS
This comparitive coding for the same form will help me understand the basic principles, uses, advantages of each. 
I will once again update my README file to elaborate on each of the following ways and advantages and disadvantages of each of the above methods used.
